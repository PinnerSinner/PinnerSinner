- 👋 Hi, I’m Marco. Welcome to the Marcoverse.
- 👀 I’m interested in AWS and the field of cloud computing as a whole. My journey begun this year in late 2022 and having already deployed test workloads, my own website and multiple articles on the subject, I aim to take these newfound skills a step further into the years ahead!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS' range of services and products. Mind you, the industry is opening up and I intend to pick up the basics of Azure an GCP in time to come.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on containerisation and event-driven serverless workloads. Anything to put my knowledge to use, and test me a bit further. 
- 📫 Send me a line over at mballalbarran+git@gmail.com for related queries!
